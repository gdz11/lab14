# Lab 10

1. Create an angular project with routing and ssr (server side rendering) support.  
3. Add student list component with links to student details component.  
4. Run the project. Check that SSR works: the fully rendered page is returned from the server for all routable links(student list and student details) when opened directly (by copy-pasting the URL to the browser window address bar).
